### Introduction
PDE Image Inpainting method running on GPU with CUDA, Tensorflow, and Theano. This
work  show  benchmark  performance  of  PDE  image  inpainting running on CPU using C++, Theano, and Tensorflow and on GPU with CUDA, Theano, and Tensorflow. The benchmark shows that parallel  computing  accelerated  PDE  image  inpainting  can  run faster  on  GPU  either  with  CUDA,  Theano,  or  Tensorflow compared to PDE image inpainting running on CPU.
